## [1.7.2] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed
- **Audio Resource Leak on macOS**: Fixed issue where system audio quality remained degraded ("muffled") after stopping recording
  - **Problem**: When recording started, macOS ScreenCaptureKit captured system audio via audio tap, but when recording stopped, the SCStream was not properly released. This caused macOS to keep the audio tap active, resulting in muffled/degraded system audio until app restart.
  - **Root Cause**: `removeStreamOutput()` was not called before `stopCapture()`, leaving stream outputs attached and preventing proper resource cleanup
  - **Solution**: Implemented correct 6-step cleanup sequence based on Apple best practices:
    1. Stop delegates to prevent new data processing
    2. Wait for pending operations in outputQueue to complete
    3. **Call `removeStreamOutput()` BEFORE `stopCapture()`** (critical step!)
    4. Call `stopCapture()` to release audio tap
    5. Clear all object references for ARC
    6. Final delay for macOS to process resource release
  - **Result**: System audio now returns to normal quality immediately after stopping recording

### Technical
- `backend/audio/screencapture/Sources/main.swift`:
  - Added `waitForPendingOperations()` method to `AudioCaptureDelegate` for sync on outputQueue
  - New 6-step `performCleanup()` async function with proper cleanup order
  - Added `removeStreamOutput()` calls before `stopCapture()`
  - Signal handlers use semaphore to wait for async cleanup on separate queue
  - Increased cleanup delay to 200ms for resource release
- `backend/audio/screencapture_darwin.go`:
  - Increased graceful shutdown timeout to 5 seconds
  - Added wait after Kill() to ensure process termination

## [1.7.0] - 2025-12-04

### Added
- **Speaker Diarization for Sys Channel**: Implemented speaker recognition and separation for the system audio channel (Interlocutor)
  - Uses `WeSpeaker ResNet34` model (ONNX) to identify unique speakers
  - Automatically labels speakers as `[Speaker 0]`, `[Speaker 1]`, etc.
  - Works on top of any transcription model (Whisper Turbo, GigaAM)
  - Integrated into real-time transcription and re-transcription processes
  - Requires downloading `WeSpeaker ResNet34` from Model Manager

### Technical
- **New AI Architecture**:
  - Added `SpeakerEncoder` service for voice embedding extraction
  - Added `Diarizer` service for clustering speaker embeddings
  - Refactored audio processing logic into `mel_spectrogram.go` for reuse between GigaAM and Diarization
  - Updated `main.go` to support speaker diarization pipeline
  - Added `Speaker` field to `TranscriptSegment` struct

## [1.6.3] - 2025-12-04

### Fixed
- **Retranscription Quality**: Fixed quality degradation during retranscription compared to real-time transcription
  - Root cause: `TranscribeHighQuality` used `MaxContext=0` which disabled context, hurting recognition quality
  - Solution: Unified Whisper parameters between `TranscribeWithSegments` (realtime) and `TranscribeHighQuality` (retranscription)
  - Now uses `MaxContext=-1` (full context) for better accuracy
  - Unified `MaxTokensPerSegment=128` for consistency
  - Added `hasSignificantAudio` check to filter empty/quiet segments

### Changed
- **Removed Auto-Retranscription**: Removed automatic retranscription after recording stop
  - Auto-retranscription was causing confusion and unexpected behavior
  - Users now have full control - retranscription only happens when manually triggered
  - Removed "Авто-распознавание" checkbox from settings
  - Removed `autoRetranscribe` from app settings and localStorage

### Technical
- `backend/ai/whisper.go`:
  - `TranscribeHighQuality()` now uses same parameters as `TranscribeWithSegments()`
  - `MaxContext` changed from `0` to `-1` (use full context)
  - `MaxTokensPerSegment` changed from `256` to `128`
  - Added `hasSignificantAudio()` check for consistency
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`:
  - Removed auto-retranscription logic from `session_stopped` handler
  - Removed `autoRetranscribe` state and ref
  - Removed auto-retranscription checkbox from settings UI
- `frontend/src/types/models.ts`:
  - Removed `autoRetranscribe` from `AppSettings` interface

## [1.6.2] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- **Chunk Preservation During Retranscription**: Fixed critical bug where chunks were merged into one after full retranscription
  - Root cause: Chunks were not loaded into memory when session was retrieved
  - Solution: Added automatic chunk loading from disk in both `UpdateFullTranscription` and `retranscribe_full` handler
  - Now properly preserves original chunk structure (e.g., 27 chunks stay as 27 chunks)

### Added
- **Cancel Button for Full Retranscription**: Added ability to cancel ongoing full retranscription
  - Cancel button appears in the progress bar during retranscription
  - Properly stops the transcription goroutine with cleanup
  - Uses WaitGroup for safe goroutine synchronization

### Technical
- `backend/session/manager.go`:
  - `UpdateFullTranscription()` now loads chunks from disk if not in memory
  - Added detailed logging for chunk loading and distribution
- `backend/main.go`:
  - `retranscribe_full` goroutine loads chunks from disk before processing
  - Added `sort` import for chunk ordering
  - Added `fullTranscriptionCancel` channel and `fullTranscriptionWg` WaitGroup
  - Added `cancel_full_transcription` WebSocket handler
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`:
  - Added cancel button UI with spinner animation
  - Added `isCancellingTranscription` state for debounce
  - Handles `full_transcription_cancelled` message

## [1.5.6] - 2024-12-03

### Changed
- **Chunk-Based Full Retranscription**: Full retranscription now uses existing chunks instead of arbitrary 20-minute segments
  - Chunks are already cut at natural speech boundaries during recording
  - This preserves context and improves transcription quality
  - Fallback to 20-minute segments for old sessions without chunk boundaries

- **Unified VAD for Stereo Channels**: Both mic and sys channels now use the same speech region map
  - Solves timestamp desynchronization between speakers
  - Uses `CreateUnifiedSpeechRegions()` which mixes channels via max(abs) amplitude
  - Both channels are mapped to the same timeline for accurate dialogue ordering

### Technical
- `main.go`: Refactored `retranscribe_full` handler
  - Added `ProcessingSegment` struct to unify chunk and fallback segment handling
  - Checks for valid `StartMs`/`EndMs` in existing chunks
  - Uses `session.CreateUnifiedSpeechRegions()` instead of separate VAD per channel
  - Adds chunk offset to final timestamps for correct global positioning
- `session/vad.go`: `CreateUnifiedSpeechRegions()` already implemented in v1.5.5

## [1.5.1] - 2024-12-03

### Added
- **Chunked Transcription for Long Files**: Audio files are now split into 20-minute segments for reliable transcription
  - Solves the issue where files >25 minutes were not transcribed at all
  - Each segment is processed independently with proper timestamp offsetting
  - Progress indicator shows current segment (e.g., "Segment 2/3")
  - Works for both stereo and mono modes

### Technical
- `main.go`: Added `maxSegmentDurationMs` constant (20 minutes)
- Stereo mode: Loops through segments, extracts audio, runs VAD, transcribes, and merges results
- Mono mode: Same segmentation approach for consistency
- Timestamps are correctly offset by segment start time

## [1.5.0] - 2024-12-03

### Added
- **High-Quality Transcription Mode**: New `TranscribeHighQuality()` method for full file retranscription

  - MaxTokensPerSegment increased to 256 for longer sentences
  - MaxContext=0 to prevent hallucination loops
  - Used automatically for full file retranscription

- **AI-Powered Transcription Improvement**: Post-processing with LLM via Ollama
  - New "Improve with AI" button (purple layers icon) in session header
  - Fixes recognition errors, punctuation, and capitalization
  - Uses configured Ollama model (same as summary generation)
  - New WebSocket messages: `improve_transcription`, `improve_started`, `improve_completed`, `improve_error`
  - New backend functions: `improveTranscriptionWithLLM()`, `parseImprovedDialogue()`, `UpdateImprovedDialogue()`

### Changed

## [1.3.1] - 2024-12-03

### Fixed
- **VAD Mapping for Word Timestamps**: Applied VAD time mapping to word-level timestamps
  - **Problem**: Word timestamps were not being mapped through VAD regions, causing incorrect chronology
  - **Solution**: Added `MapWhisperTimeToRealTime()` function and applied it to all words in all transcription paths
  - Now words have correct real-time timestamps that account for pauses in audio

### Technical
- `session/vad.go`: Added `MapWhisperTimeToRealTime()` for single timestamp mapping
- `main.go`: Updated all 6 VAD mapping locations to also map word timestamps

## [1.3.0] - 2024-12-03

### Added
- **Word-Level Timestamps**: Implemented precise word-level timestamps using whisper.cpp token timestamps
  - Each word now has its own start/end time, not just segments
  - Enables accurate dialogue chronology even when Whisper merges multiple phrases into one segment
  - New `TranscriptWord` structure with `Start`, `End`, `Text`, `P` (confidence), `Speaker`

### Changed
- **Improved Dialogue Merging**: New `mergeWordsToDialogue()` function creates dialogue from word-level data
  - Words from both channels (mic/sys) are sorted by timestamp
  - Consecutive words from same speaker are grouped into phrases
  - Phrases are split on speaker change OR pause > 1 second
  - Falls back to segment-level merging if word data unavailable

### Technical
- `ai/whisper.go`: Added `TranscriptWord` struct and `extractWordsFromTokens()` function
- `session/types.go`: Added `TranscriptWord` struct and `Words` field to `TranscriptSegment`
- `session/manager.go`: New `mergeWordsToDialogue()` for word-level dialogue creation
- `main.go`: Updated `convertSegmentsWithGlobalOffset()` to include word timestamps

## [1.2.5] - 2024-12-03

### Fixed
- **Complete Timestamp Synchronization Fix**: Implemented multi-region VAD mapping for accurate timestamps
  - **Problem**: Whisper "compresses" silence - returns timestamps relative to speech, not audio. Multiple speech regions with pauses caused wrong timestamps for all segments after first pause
  - **Solution**: New `DetectSpeechRegions()` finds ALL speech regions, `MapWhisperSegmentsToRealTime()` maps Whisper's compressed timestamps to real audio time
  - Applied to all three transcription paths: WAV, MP3 fallback, and re-transcription

### Technical
- New VAD functions in `session/vad.go`:
  - `SpeechRegion` struct with StartMs/EndMs
  - `DetectSpeechRegions()` - finds all speech regions (20ms window, 300ms silence to end region, 100ms minimum)
  - `MapWhisperSegmentsToRealTime()` - distributes Whisper segments across detected speech regions
- Replaced simple `DetectSpeechStart()` with multi-region approach in retranscribe handler

## [1.2.4] - 2024-12-03

### Fixed
- **Sys Channel Timestamp Correction**: Fixed timestamps for sys (Собеседник) channel
  - **Problem**: VAD offset was only applied when `Whisper.Start == 0`, but Whisper often returns `Start > 0` even with silence at the beginning
  - **Solution**: Compare VAD speech start with Whisper's first segment start, adjust if Whisper started earlier than VAD detected speech
  - Now both mic and sys channels use the same improved logic
  - Example: VAD detects speech at 8000ms, Whisper returns Start=1600ms → adjust by +6400ms

### Technical
- Changed condition from `Whisper.Start == 0` to `Whisper.Start < VAD.Start`
- Applied fix to all three transcription paths: WAV, MP3 fallback, and re-transcription
- Added detailed logging: `VAD=Xms, Whisper=Yms, adjusting by +Zms`

## [1.2.3] - 2024-12-03

### Fixed
- **Re-transcription VAD Offset**: Applied VAD offset fix to re-transcription path

## [1.2.2] - 2024-12-03

### Fixed
- **Smart VAD Offset for Silent Starts**: Fixed timestamps when channel starts with silence
  - **Problem**: Whisper returns `Start=0ms` even when speech starts later in the audio
  - **Solution**: Use VAD to find real speech start, but only when Whisper returns `Start=0ms`

### Changed
- **Removed Large V3 Russian model** from registry (inconsistent quality)
- **Large V3 now recommended** alongside Turbo (best quality for complex dialogues)

## [1.2.1] - 2024-12-03
